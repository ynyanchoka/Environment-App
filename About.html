                <p>We are an environmental club at Open Institute Universitythat seeks
                    to protect the environment  from deserts to oceans to rain forests.
                   We address three major issues that affect the majority of them 
                   overall: global warming and climate change; water pollution 
                   and ocean acidification; and loss of biodiversity
